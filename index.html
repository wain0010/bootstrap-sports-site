                    <p>
                    There is 3 divisions here at Capital, essentially separated into age groups. <strong>Division A</strong> is for players from                       18 to 25 years old. <strong>Division B</strong> is for players ranging from 14 to 17 years old, and <strong>Division                               C</strong> is for players ranging from 10 to 13 years old. All three divisions are co-ed. No prior dodgeball experience is                         required; teams must practice on their own time or accord. If you live in Ottawa and want to join the best league around,                           check out our sign up page and fill out your info!

                <ul>
                    
                    <li>
                        Maximum of 6 players and a minimum of 2 females (one of which must be from the team’s roster) on each team at the start                             of the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Six standard IDA-approved balls (8.25” foam balls) are placed on the centerline in two groups of 3. Each group of 3 is                             placed at opposite ends of the centerline, in front of the referees.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Opening Rush: Players must be touching the back wall at the start of the game. After the starting countdown of “3, 2, 1                             Dodgeball!” teams approach the centerline to retrieve the balls.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Balls must touch the back wall before they are live. The ball is dead otherwise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Players attempt to eliminate opponents by hitting them with balls or catching their throws. If a player is hit with a                               live ball, that player is out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Eliminated players line up against the designated wall or on the sideline, which is to be announced at the start of the                             games, next to the referees, according to the order of elimination.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Players are to play by the honour system. If in doubt, player should call themselves out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         Play continues until one team is eliminated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Referee can pause the game at any point by saying, "Stop" or blowing the whistle. At that point, all events after and                               during are void.
